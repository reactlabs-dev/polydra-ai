# Code of Conduct

PolydraIQ is an open-source project that aims to model the same governance, accountability, and respect that it promotes for AI systems. We expect all contributors and community members to help maintain a professional, inclusive environment.

## 🌟 Our Standards

- Be **respectful** and **constructive** in all interactions.
- Assume **good intent** and seek to clarify before escalating disagreements.
- Welcome **new contributors** and encourage learning.
- Focus feedback on **code, ideas, and impact**, not individuals.

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include (but are not limited to):

- Harassment, discrimination, or abusive language
- Personal attacks or trolling
- Publishing others’ private information without consent
- Sustained disruption of discussions or review processes

## 🧭 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- Issues, discussions, and pull requests in this repository
- Community spaces related to the project (e.g., forums, chat)

## 📬 Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- You may contact the project maintainer at:
  - `matt.vegas@inference-stack.com`

Reports will be handled as discreetly as possible. The maintainer may take any action deemed appropriate, including temporary or permanent bans from project spaces.

## ⚖️ Enforcement

Participants asked to stop unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately. Failure to do so may result in:

- Warnings
- Temporary or permanent exclusion from contribution
- Removal of access to project resources

The goal of enforcement is to preserve a safe, productive environment for all contributors.
